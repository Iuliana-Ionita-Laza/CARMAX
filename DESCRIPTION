Description:We propose here a novel fine-mapping method (CARMA-X) for admixed settings that improves upon existing methods in several directions, including: (1) flexible prior distributions that can model heterogeneity in effects across ancestries, (2) a new method to estimate cross-ancestry LD, and (3) a Bayesian hypothesis test to detect and correct for discrepancies between summary statistics and external LD to avoid false positives.
